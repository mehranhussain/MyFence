# MyFence : A Paradigm of Meta-Search Engine

MyFence is an extensive paradigm of, what so called, Meta-Search Engine. Meta-Search is the term used to demonstrate the concept of comprehend searching. Meta-Search engine combines the different search engines to execute the query and get results at one place. MyFence did the same work, but also includes web browsing integrated with application. It combines the results of different search engines as well as the results of typical, data resources - web-pages. MyFence's goal is to provide the 'Unified-Internet-Interface (UII)' to the user to compromise all his activities, on Internet, at one place. At last, if you think that Google is the only usable search engine then be sure that you use any alternative search engine otherwise you surely suffering from 'Lock-In' effect and MyFence is the solution of your problem.

All these issues give us an opportunity to introduce a new paradigm of “The Meta-Search Engine”. This paradigm, introduced by us, will be known as MyFence which will help users to broaden their vision, to explore some hidden aspects of web search which will not otherwise be seen. As you may know Meta-search means a comprehensive search. Meta-search can be used to combine a number of search engines but we will focus on seven search engines. 
Here is the List of their names:

1. Google
2. Yahoo
3. Bing
4. Baidu
5. Yandex
6. Duckduckgo
7. Ask

But this is what a typical meta-search engine is supposed to do. We will also incorporate the typical data resources in our result to better the user’s experience which includes youtube.com for videos, kickass.so for torrents, Wikipedia.com for articles etc. 
There is one more thing we would defiantly take care about is interface. We are hoping to provide a unified interface to internet user, where he could compromise all his activities without going anywhere else. It will give the user an opportunity to solve all his problems without hectic hustle bustle. This is the main idea behind “MyFence”.
